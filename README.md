Gig Worker Sign-Up Form
Description
This is a React-based sign-up form designed for gig workers to join a platform. The form allows users to input their Name, Email, Skill Category, and Portfolio Link, with robust client-side validation and a user-friendly interface. Key features include:

Input Fields: Name (text), Email (email validation), Skill Category (dropdown with an "Other" option), and Portfolio Link (URL validation).
Custom Skill Option: Selecting "Other" in Skill Category reveals a text field to specify a custom skill.
Validation: Ensures all fields are filled correctly, with real-time error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., invalid email or URL formats).
Success Notification: Displays a react-toastify success toast upon successful submission, followed by a thank-you message.
Responsive Design: Built with Material-UI for a modern, accessible, and mobile-friendly UI.
