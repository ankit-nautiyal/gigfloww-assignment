# Gig Worker Sign-Up Form

## Description

This is a React-based sign-up form designed for gig workers to join a platform. The form allows users to input their Name, Email, Skill Category, and Portfolio Link, with robust client-side validation and a user-friendly interface. Key features include:

- **Input Fields**: Name (text), Email (email validation), Skill Category (dropdown with an "Other" option), and Portfolio Link (URL validation).
- **Custom Skill Option**: Selecting "Other" in Skill Category reveals a text field to specify a custom skill.
- **Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled correctly, with real-time error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., invalid email or URL formats).
- **Success Notification**: Displays a thank-you message upon successful submission.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Material-UI for a modern, accessible, and mobile-friendly UI.
